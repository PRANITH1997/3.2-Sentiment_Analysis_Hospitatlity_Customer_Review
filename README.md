Sentiment Analysis for Hospitality Customer Reviews
# Problem Statement
The goal of this project is to build a sentiment analysis model that can classify customer reviews and feedback for a hospitality company as positive, negative, or neutral. The model will also identify key topics or areas of concern.

# Introduction
Customer feedback is crucial in the hospitality industry as it directly impacts customer satisfaction and loyalty. Manually analyzing feedback can be time-consuming and prone to errors, especially with large volumes of data. To address this, we have developed a sentiment analysis model that automates the classification of customer reviews, providing valuable insights for improving services.

# Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis is sourced from Kaggle and contains customer reviews of a hospitality company. It includes features such as review text and star ratings, which serve as the basis for sentiment classification.

# Libraries Used
Pandas
Matplotlib/Seaborn
Wordcloud
NLTK
Scikit-learn (sklearn)
Joblib
Flask (for deployment)

# Preprocessing
Examination
Understanding the dataset's structure and features is pivotal for effective preprocessing and analysis.

# Cleaning
The dataset is free from null values.

# Splitting
Categorizing reviews based on star ratings (e.g., considering reviews below 3 stars as negative) simplifies the sentiment analysis task.

# Analyzing Text Data Using WordCloud
Visualizing word frequencies using a word cloud helps identify common themes and sentiments expressed in customer feedback.

# Preprocessing Text
Converting the text data into embeddings/vectors that the model can understand.

# Normalization
Converting text to lowercase and removing stop words standardizes the text data for further analysis.

# Lemmatization
Transforming words to their base form improves the accuracy of sentiment analysis by capturing the true meaning of words.

# Converting Sentences to Vectors
Bag of Words
Converting text data into numerical vectors using the bag of words technique enables machine learning models to process and analyze the data effectively.

# Model Selection
Pipeline
Creating a pipeline that combines preprocessing and model training streamlines the analysis process.

# Models
Experimenting with various models such as Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and Decision Tree to identify the best-performing model for sentiment analysis.

# Hyperparameter Tuning
Fine-tuning hyperparameters, such as the maximum depth of a Decision Tree, enhances the model's performance.

# Model Deployment
Saving the Model
Saving the trained model using joblib ensures its reusability and accessibility for future analysis.

# Web Application
Deploying the model as a web application using Flask and HTML allows users to interact with the sentiment analysis tool, providing real-time feedback.

# Conclusion
Our sentiment analysis model offers a scalable and efficient solution for classifying customer reviews in the hospitality industry. By accurately categorizing feedback, businesses can identify areas for improvement and enhance customer satisfaction.
